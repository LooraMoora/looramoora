## Philosophy ##

I’m a Product Designer who thinks about the Person, human behaviours and emotions.
My purpose is understanding and driving experiences: I have a strong desire to find product problems and customer needs and to solve them with design.
Making life easier for big user bases products is my persuasion.

## Method ##

Everything starts with the right questions: from the answers, I create sketches on paper to identify as many solutions as needed to achieve goals. After dismissing not working sketches, I convert the conveying ones in working prototypes, taking care of interactions, animations and flows.

I share prototypes with designers, stakeholders and developers to collect feedback in order to refine the prototype and take care of the details.
After that I iterate in an Agile process with developers to give life to the prototype.

## Properties ##

I have experience in UI design of iOS and Android native apps, following two different operating system patterns, and responsive web-application too.

## Interests ##

I have a deep interest in psychology and in UX research methods.
